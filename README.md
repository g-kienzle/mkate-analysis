# mkate-analysis

This is a PyTorch-based regression model of the protein analysis dataset created by Ranganathan et al. It predicts the expression of a protein in the landscape given its comparison to two "endpoints" of the landscape.

Run mkate_create to generate, train, and graph a model based on depth from endpoints, run mkate_load to graph a pretrained model.
